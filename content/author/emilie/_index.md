I'm Emilie. I am a researcher and biostatistics student at UCLA working with [Dr. Damla Senturk](http://dsenturk.bol.ucla.edu/). I have two broad areas of interest: methodology for analyzing multi-task EEG data and data visualization. As a student in a collaborative science, I believe it is not only important to develop novel statistical methods, but also to communicate results to practitioners. I am the Co-President of the [Biostatistics Student Association](http://ucla-bsa.netlify.com) at UCLA as well as an active member of the LA East R Users Group and R-Ladies. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid knitter and dog mom.
