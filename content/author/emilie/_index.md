I'm Emilie. I am a data analyst and biostatistics student at UCLA working with [Dr. Damla Senturk](http://dsenturk.bol.ucla.edu/). I have two broad areas of interest: methodology for analyzing multi-task EEG data and data visualization. As a collaborative scientist, I believe it is not only important to develop novel statistical methods, but also to communicate results to non-technical audiences. 

In addition to my data-centric pursuits, I am an avid knitter and dog mom.
